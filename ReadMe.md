# Advanced TDD

## XP Simple Design (Kent Beck)
    -   Passes all tests
    -   Clear, expressive, consistent
    -   No Duplication
    -   Minimize

### Example mapping
    -   Examples may become automated tests
        -   The good thing about automated test is that they either pass or fail

### What are Unit Tests?
    -   They are whatever they need to be
    -   The biggest thing is that they are fast and there should be many
    -   They need to be cheap
        -   Fast to write
        -   Easy to maintain

### Don't Trust A Test You Haven't Seen Fail!   

## Uncle Bob's Three Laws of TDD
    - First Law : You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
    - Second Law : You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficent to fail, and not compiling is failing.
    - Third Law : You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

## ZOMBIES
        -       Z = Zero
        -       O = One
        -       M = Many
        -       B = Boundaries
        -       I = Interfaces
        -       E = Exceptions
        -       S =

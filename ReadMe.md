# Advanced TDD

## XP Simple Design (Kent Beck)
    -   Passes all tests
    -   Clear, expressive, consistent
    -   No Duplication
    -   Minimize

### Example mapping
    -   Examples may become automated tests
        -   The good thing about automated test is that they either pass or fail

### What are Unit Tests?
    -   They are whatever they need to be
    -   The biggest thing is that they are fast and there should be many
    -   They need to be cheap
        -   Fast to write
        -   Easy to maintain
